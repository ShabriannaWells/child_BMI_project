# child_BMI_project
The objective of this project was to analyze the average BMI of children and teens aged 5-19 among urban and rural populations across the world. The data featured was collected over a period of 30 years (1990-2020) and includes measures from around 200 countries/territories. BMI measurements were also divided by sex (boy and girl). The main questions for discussion are:

1.  Is there a significant difference between mean BMI among urban and rural populations?
2.  Is there a significant difference between mean BMI and GDP?  (In other words, do more developed countries have a significantly different mean BMI than less developed countries?)
3.   Is there a significant difference between mean BMI and geographical region?
4.    Is there a relationship between mean BMI and age?
     

The structure of this code base is R. 
-  Data folder contains a csv file with the BMI data and shape files associated with dividing the countries listed in the csv file into different geographical regions.
-  Scripts folder contains R script used to analyze data.

Results of this project can be recreated using the data and R script mentioned. Required R packages that would need to be installed include ggplot2, sf, and dplyr.

Special thanks to  NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) for providing the raw data feautured in this project, the World Bank for providing income classifications for each country mentioned, and World Food Programme for publishing the shape file feautured in this project on the opendatasoft website.
